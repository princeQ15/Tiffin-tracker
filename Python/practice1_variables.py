# Practice Exercise 1: Variables and Data Types

# Task 1: Create variables of different types
# Create a string variable named 'name' with your name
# Create an integer variable named 'age' with any age
# Create a float variable named 'height' with any height in meters
# Create a boolean variable named 'is_student' indicating if you're a student or not

# Your code here:
name = ""  # Replace with your name
age = 0    # Replace with an age
height = 0.0  # Replace with a height
is_student = False  # Set to True or False

# Task 2: String operations
# Create a variable 'greeting' that combines "Hello, " with the name variable and an exclamation mark
# Example: If name is "John", greeting should be "Hello, John!"

# Your code here:
greeting = ""  # Use string concatenation

# Task 3: Basic calculations
# Calculate and store the following:
# - 'years_to_100': How many years until the age reaches 100
# - 'height_in_feet': Convert the height from meters to feet (1 meter = 3.28084 feet)
# - 'is_adult': Boolean that is True if age is 18 or more, False otherwise

# Your code here:
years_to_100 = 0  # Calculate years to reach 100
height_in_feet = 0.0  # Convert height to feet
is_adult = False  # Check if age >= 18

# Task 4: Print formatted output
# Print a summary using an f-string that includes all the information above
# Example: "John is 25 years old, 1.75 meters (5.74 feet) tall, and is an adult. John will be 100 in 75 years."
# Add "John is a student." or "John is not a student." based on the is_student variable

# Your code here:
summary = ""  # Create a formatted summary string
print(summary)

# Task 5: Type conversion
# Ask the user to input their birth year, convert it to an integer, and calculate their approximate age
# Print the result

# Your code here:
birth_year = input("Enter your birth year: ")  # Get user input
# Convert to integer and calculate age
# Print the result

# Bonus: Try to handle the case where the user enters something that's not a number

# When you're done, run this file to see if your code works correctly!
